This app is a social network with photos. ❗️The app was tested on iOS devices with a screen size of
6.46 inches.❗️ Firebase was used for this app to login/sign up, as well as to store comments,
photos etc.⚡️

When the application starts, custom fonts are loaded. A user gets to the "login" screen but if user
is not registered yet - the user can switch to the "registration" screen. During registration the
user can set an avatar for his account if desired.

After successful registration, thw user gets to the "home" screen where the posts of various users,
the number of likes and the number of comments under each photos can be seen. Also user can go to
the "comments" screen on the clicked photo, and to the "map" screen to see a marker where a photo
was taken. By going to the "comments" screen, user can view existing comments or write his/her own.

Also, after registration/login, the user can see the bottom navigation menu with three buttons. The
first is the "home/all posts" screen, the second is "create a new post", and the third is "user
profile".

When going to the "create a new post" screen, the user is asked once for permission to access
location and the camera. The user can take a photo on the main or front camera as well as reshoot an
unsuccessful snapshot. In order to create a post, the user must fill in the field with a description
of the photo and the place where it was taken, after which the button "post" will be active. When
the button "post" is pressed, post is going to be published and the user will flip to the "home/all
posts" screen. The user can clear all fields and also delete the taken photo using the "delete all"
button. The user can also exit from "home/all posts" screen to "home/all posts" by pressing arrow
